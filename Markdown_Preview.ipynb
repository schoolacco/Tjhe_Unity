    "## **Problem Statement**\n",
    "---\n",
    "Nearly all games are made for the purpose of entertainment, hence each game is made to cater to a specific audience of people who enjoy a specific aspect, my game is intended for prior players of Undertale using similar mechanics and some unique ones to create a unique challenge for the player, although there are already many Undertale fangames, there is no harm in having another (as long as it's well developed)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Skill Development**\n",
    "---\n",
    "Firstly to possibly develop a small overworld and develop the battle mechanics I will likely have to use the [2D Top Down RPG Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmyRnlXbZcA&list=PL6bqhqO0Ba776ksb3F9P_xmUMT9WvmfFT&index=51) (the other tutorial is blocked) and for the rest of the game I'll likely have to recreate scratch projects in Unity or try and find general help online.\n",

    "\n",
    "* User inputs with directional arrows keys or WASD to move in the corresponding direction (in the menu, in the battle or in the overworld)\n",
    "* User inputs with Z, X and C keys to interact with the menu (Z to interact, X to exit the specific part of the menu, C to quickly skip dialogue)\n",
    "* User may be able to hover the cursor over specific areas of the screen and click to activate an easter egg\n",

    "---\n",
    "The program is able to update variables based on previously mentioned inputs and collision with 'bullets' as well as in-game events.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After the user input for movement the game will move the player across the menu or in the battle in the correspondingly related direction to the input, it will check to see if the movement is possible, if not nothing will happen\n",
    "* After the user inputs a non-movement menu input it will update the menu depending on which option was selected, it will process which input it was\n",
    "* After the user clicks in the correct place the program will update a related variable for the easter egg or immediately show it\n",
    "* If the player has a skill issue and they get hit by a 'bullet' they will lose a set amount of health and recieve KARMA damage, the program will process the damage and if it is the end of the turn, the amount of KARMA\n",
    "* If the user's health is 0 a small death animation will be played before being taken to the game over screen\n",
    "* If the player wins a cutscene will be triggered (this may lead to further phases)\n",

    "The program shows the user the corresponding movement/menu change/gameover/easter egg based on the previously mentioned process.\n",

    "* When the player moves they will see the player character move (in battle or in the overworld)\n",
    "* When the player moves in the menu they will the menu option change\n",
    "* When the player inputs in the menu they will see the menu change\n",
    "* When the player gets hit the displayed health will lower and the displayed KARMA will increase and a sound will play for every hit (no i-frames because the damage will be low)\n",
    "* When the player triggers an easter egg it will be seen and they may recieve an achievement for it (also shown on screen)\n",
    "* If the player dies they will see the death animation before being sent to the gameover screen (which they will also see)\n",
    "* If the player wins they will witness a cutscene\n",

    "The user will able to use keyboard inputs (and some mouse clicks) to input (refer to the entire **Inputs** section), to summarise the player will be able to move around, in the menu, overworld and battle, the player will be able to interact with the regular menu and battle menu and the player may be able to click in specific places to trigger... some secrets (exact details in the **Inputs** sections)\n",

    "  - The user presses one of the arrow keys/WASD\n",
    "  - The player character moves in the corresponding direction\n",
    "     - Diagonal movement is possible in battle\n",
    "* Movement (Menu/Battle Menu)\n",
    "  - The user uses the arrow keys/WASD to switch between options in the menu\n",
    "     - In battle the user may need to dodge in the menu \n",
    "  - The Z key is used to select an option and the X key is used to go back to the previous menu\n",
    "* Combat\n",
    "  - When the user triggers the fight they will be given a menu with 4 options: FIGHT, ACT, ITEM and MERCY (the last of which will be cracked)\n",
    "  - Selecting FIGHT will give the player a small minigame where they must land a moving line as close to the center as possible to deal as much damage as possible\n",
    "  - Selecting ACT will give the player further options for interaction, they may or may not have an effect\n",
    "  - Selecting ITEM will give the player their inventory, they will be able to interact with items in it to heal\n",
    "  - Selecting **~~MERCY will allow the player to spare the enemy given that the enemy also wants to spare the player~~**\n",
    "  - Whatever option is chosen the player will have to dodge an attack via dodging a 'bullet pattern' (bullet hell type stuff) via movement\n",
    "  - The user will be able to skip dialogue, Z proceeds to the next part of the dialogue, X immediately displays the segment of dialogue and C immediately displays and then skips the segment of dialogue and is the only one able to be held down\n",

    "## **Scoring and Feedback**\n",
    "---\n",
    "* Achievements\n",
    "  - The user reaches certain milestones or find secrets they will be awarded achievements (this is basically the only scoring type thing)\n",

    "## **Level Progression or Simulation Stages** \n",
    "---\n",
    "* Phases\n",
    "  - The user actually manages to defeat the enemy, some cool cutscene happens which moves the player to the next phase, they recieve a checkpoint every phase\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Saving and Loading Data**\n",
    "---\n",
    "* Progress\n",
    "  - Progress (achievements and checkpoints) will be saved locally and accessed and loaded when the game is opened\n",
